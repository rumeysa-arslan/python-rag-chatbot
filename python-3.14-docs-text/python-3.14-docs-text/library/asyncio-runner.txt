Runners
*******

**Source code:** Lib/asyncio/runners.py

This section outlines high-level asyncio primitives to run asyncio
code.

They are built on top of an event loop with the aim to simplify async
code usage for common wide-spread scenarios.

* Running an asyncio Program

* Runner context manager

* Handling Keyboard Interruption


Running an asyncio Program
==========================

asyncio.run(coro, *, debug=None, loop_factory=None)

   Execute *coro* in an asyncio event loop and return the result.

   The argument can be any awaitable object.

   This function runs the awaitable, taking care of managing the
   asyncio event loop, *finalizing asynchronous generators*, and
   closing the executor.

   This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is
   running in the same thread.

   If *debug* is "True", the event loop will be run in debug mode.
   "False" disables debug mode explicitly. "None" is used to respect
   the global Debug Mode settings.

   If *loop_factory* is not "None", it is used to create a new event
   loop; otherwise "asyncio.new_event_loop()" is used. The loop is
   closed at the end. This function should be used as a main entry
   point for asyncio programs, and should ideally only be called once.
   It is recommended to use *loop_factory* to configure the event loop
   instead of policies. Passing "asyncio.EventLoop" allows running
   asyncio without the policy system.

   The executor is given a timeout duration of 5 minutes to shutdown.
   If the executor hasn't finished within that duration, a warning is
   emitted and the executor is closed.

   Example:

      async def main():
          await asyncio.sleep(1)
          print('hello')

      asyncio.run(main())

   Added in version 3.7.

   Changed in version 3.9: Updated to use
   "loop.shutdown_default_executor()".

   Changed in version 3.10: *debug* is "None" by default to respect
   the global debug mode settings.

   Changed in version 3.12: Added *loop_factory* parameter.

   Changed in version 3.14: *coro* can be any awaitable object.

   Note:

     The "asyncio" policy system is deprecated and will be removed in
     Python 3.16; from there on, an explicit *loop_factory* is needed
     to configure the event loop.


Runner context manager
======================

class asyncio.Runner(*, debug=None, loop_factory=None)

   A context manager that simplifies *multiple* async function calls
   in the same context.

   Sometimes several top-level async functions should be called in the
   same event loop and "contextvars.Context".

   If *debug* is "True", the event loop will be run in debug mode.
   "False" disables debug mode explicitly. "None" is used to respect
   the global Debug Mode settings.

   *loop_factory* could be used for overriding the loop creation. It
   is the responsibility of the *loop_factory* to set the created loop
   as the current one. By default "asyncio.new_event_loop()" is used
   and set as current event loop with "asyncio.set_event_loop()" if
   *loop_factory* is "None".

   Basically, "asyncio.run()" example can be rewritten with the runner
   usage:

      async def main():
          await asyncio.sleep(1)
          print('hello')

      with asyncio.Runner() as runner:
          runner.run(main())

   Added in version 3.11.

   run(coro, *, context=None)

      Execute *coro* in the embedded event loop.

      The argument can be any awaitable object.

      If the argument is a coroutine, it is wrapped in a Task.

      An optional keyword-only *context* argument allows specifying a
      custom "contextvars.Context" for the code to run in. The
      runner's default context is used if context is "None".

      Returns the awaitable's result or raises an exception.

      This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop
      is running in the same thread.

      Changed in version 3.14: *coro* can be any awaitable object.

   close()

      Close the runner.

      Finalize asynchronous generators, shutdown default executor,
      close the event loop and release embedded "contextvars.Context".

   get_loop()

      Return the event loop associated with the runner instance.

   Note:

     "Runner" uses the lazy initialization strategy, its constructor
     doesn't initialize underlying low-level structures.Embedded
     *loop* and *context* are created at the "with" body entering or
     the first call of "run()" or "get_loop()".


Handling Keyboard Interruption
==============================

Added in version 3.11.

When "signal.SIGINT" is raised by "Ctrl"-"C", "KeyboardInterrupt"
exception is raised in the main thread by default. However this
doesn't work with "asyncio" because it can interrupt asyncio internals
and can hang the program from exiting.

To mitigate this issue, "asyncio" handles "signal.SIGINT" as follows:

1. "asyncio.Runner.run()" installs a custom "signal.SIGINT" handler
   before any user code is executed and removes it when exiting from
   the function.

2. The "Runner" creates the main task for the passed coroutine for its
   execution.

3. When "signal.SIGINT" is raised by "Ctrl"-"C", the custom signal
   handler cancels the main task by calling "asyncio.Task.cancel()"
   which raises "asyncio.CancelledError" inside the main task.  This
   causes the Python stack to unwind, "try/except" and "try/finally"
   blocks can be used for resource cleanup.  After the main task is
   cancelled, "asyncio.Runner.run()" raises "KeyboardInterrupt".

4. A user could write a tight loop which cannot be interrupted by
   "asyncio.Task.cancel()", in which case the second following
   "Ctrl"-"C" immediately raises the "KeyboardInterrupt" without
   cancelling the main task.
