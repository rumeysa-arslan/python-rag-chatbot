"__future__" --- Future statement definitions
*********************************************

**Source code:** Lib/__future__.py

======================================================================

Imports of the form "from __future__ import feature" are called future
statements. These are special-cased by the Python compiler to allow
the use of new Python features in modules containing the future
statement before the release in which the feature becomes standard.

While these future statements are given additional special meaning by
the Python compiler, they are still executed like any other import
statement and the "__future__" exists and is handled by the import
system the same way any other Python module would be. This design
serves three purposes:

* To avoid confusing existing tools that analyze import statements and
  expect to find the modules they're importing.

* To document when incompatible changes were introduced, and when they
  will be --- or were --- made mandatory.  This is a form of
  executable documentation, and can be inspected programmatically via
  importing "__future__" and examining its contents.

* To ensure that future statements run under releases prior to Python
  2.1 at least yield runtime exceptions (the import of "__future__"
  will fail, because there was no module of that name prior to 2.1).


Module Contents
===============

No feature description will ever be deleted from "__future__". Since
its introduction in Python 2.1 the following features have found their
way into the language using this mechanism:

class __future__._Feature

   Each statement in "__future__.py" is of the form:

      FeatureName = _Feature(OptionalRelease, MandatoryRelease,
                             CompilerFlag)

   where, normally, *OptionalRelease* is less than *MandatoryRelease*,
   and both are 5-tuples of the same form as "sys.version_info":

      (PY_MAJOR_VERSION, # the 2 in 2.1.0a3; an int
       PY_MINOR_VERSION, # the 1; an int
       PY_MICRO_VERSION, # the 0; an int
       PY_RELEASE_LEVEL, # "alpha", "beta", "candidate" or "final"; string
       PY_RELEASE_SERIAL # the 3; an int
      )

_Feature.getOptionalRelease()

   *OptionalRelease* records the first release in which the feature
   was accepted.

_Feature.getMandatoryRelease()

   In the case of a *MandatoryRelease* that has not yet occurred,
   *MandatoryRelease* predicts the release in which the feature will
   become part of the language.

   Else *MandatoryRelease* records when the feature became part of the
   language; in releases at or after that, modules no longer need a
   future statement to use the feature in question, but may continue
   to use such imports.

   *MandatoryRelease* may also be "None", meaning that a planned
   feature got dropped or that it is not yet decided.

_Feature.compiler_flag

   *CompilerFlag* is the (bitfield) flag that should be passed in the
   fourth argument to the built-in function "compile()" to enable the
   feature in dynamically compiled code.  This flag is stored in the
   "_Feature.compiler_flag" attribute on "_Feature" instances.

[1] "from __future__ import annotations" was previously scheduled to
    become mandatory in Python 3.10, but the change was delayed and
    ultimately canceled. This feature will eventually be deprecated
    and removed. See **PEP 649** and **PEP 749**.
