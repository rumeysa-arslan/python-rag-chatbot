"imghdr" --- Determine the type of an image
*******************************************

Deprecated since version 3.11, removed in version 3.13.

This module is no longer part of the Python standard library. It was
removed in Python 3.13 after being deprecated in Python 3.11.  The
removal was decided in **PEP 594**.

Possible replacements are third-party libraries from PyPI: filetype,
puremagic, or python-magic. These are not supported or maintained by
the Python core team.

The last version of Python that provided the "imghdr" module was
Python 3.12.
