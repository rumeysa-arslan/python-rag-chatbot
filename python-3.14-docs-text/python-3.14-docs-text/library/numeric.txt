Numeric and Mathematical Modules
********************************

The modules described in this chapter provide numeric and math-related
functions and data types. The "numbers" module defines an abstract
hierarchy of numeric types. The "math" and "cmath" modules contain
various mathematical functions for floating-point and complex numbers.
The "decimal" module supports exact representations of decimal
numbers, using arbitrary precision arithmetic.
