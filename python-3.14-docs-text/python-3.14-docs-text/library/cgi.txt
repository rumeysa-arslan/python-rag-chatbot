"cgi" --- Common Gateway Interface support
******************************************

Deprecated since version 3.11, removed in version 3.13.

This module is no longer part of the Python standard library. It was
removed in Python 3.13 after being deprecated in Python 3.11.  The
removal was decided in **PEP 594**.

A fork of the module on PyPI can be used instead: legacy-cgi. This is
a copy of the cgi module, no longer maintained or supported by the
core Python team.

The last version of Python that provided the "cgi" module was Python
3.12.
