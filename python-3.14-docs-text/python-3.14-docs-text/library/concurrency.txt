Concurrent Execution
********************

The modules described in this chapter provide support for concurrent
execution of code. The appropriate choice of tool will depend on the
task to be executed (CPU bound vs IO bound) and preferred style of
development (event driven cooperative multitasking vs preemptive
multitasking). Here's an overview:

* "threading" --- Thread-based parallelism

  * Introduction

  * GIL and performance considerations

    * RLock objects

    * Condition objects

    * Semaphore objects

    * "Semaphore" example

    * Event objects

    * Timer objects

    * Barrier objects

  * Using locks, conditions, and semaphores in the "with" statement

* "multiprocessing" --- Process-based parallelism

  * Introduction

    * The "Process" class

    * Contexts and start methods

    * Exchanging objects between processes

    * Synchronization between processes

    * Using a pool of workers

  * Reference

    * "Process" and exceptions

    * Pipes and Queues

    * Miscellaneous

    * Connection Objects

    * Synchronization primitives

    * Shared "ctypes" Objects

      * The "multiprocessing.sharedctypes" module

    * Managers

      * Customized managers

      * Using a remote manager
