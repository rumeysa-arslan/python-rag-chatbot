The "compression" package
*************************

Added in version 3.14.

The "compression" package contains the canonical compression modules
containing interfaces to several different compression algorithms.
Some of these modules have historically been available as separate
modules; those will continue to be available under their original
names for compatibility reasons, and will not be removed without a
deprecation cycle. The use of modules in "compression" is encouraged
where practical.

* "compression.bz2" -- Re-exports "bz2"

* "compression.gzip" -- Re-exports "gzip"

* "compression.lzma" -- Re-exports "lzma"

* "compression.zlib" -- Re-exports "zlib"

* "compression.zstd" -- Wrapper for the Zstandard compression library
